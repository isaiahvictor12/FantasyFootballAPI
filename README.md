# FantasyFootballAPI

Since the ESPN Fantasy API has absolutely no documentation, I had to use code from multiple sources to help pull data and put into CSV files. The sources are https://www.youtube.com/@Timbryan22 and https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-v3.html.
All of the parts working with using the data from the CSV file are my own code. A lot of the code working with data frames has been altered or written by me. My plan is to create several different calculations I can do and to create visuals for them.

I have created a folder showing some of the results of my work. My hope is to be able to figure out how to pull any of the data that could be useful and store it in easy to intrepret ways. Then I want to create visualizations from this data that could be understoof easily by anyone with a basic understanding of Fantasy Football.
