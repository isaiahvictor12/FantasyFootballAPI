# FantasyFootballAPI

Since the ESPN Fantasy API has absolutely no documentation, I had to use code from multiple sources to help pull data and put into CSV files. The sources are https://www.youtube.com/@Timbryan22 and https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-v3.html.
All of the parts working with using the data from the CSV file are my own code. My plan is to create several different calculations I can do and to create visuals for them.
